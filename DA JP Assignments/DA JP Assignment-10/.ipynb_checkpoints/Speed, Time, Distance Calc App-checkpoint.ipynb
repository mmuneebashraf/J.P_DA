    "Write a Python program to calculate Speed, Distance, or Time based on user input.\n",

    "### Program Title:\n",
    "\n",
    "Speed, Distance, and Time Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "### Program Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop a program that calculates Speed, Distance, or Time based on the user’s choice and input values, using the standard motion formulas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "This program helps users calculate one of the three motion parameters — Speed, Distance, or Time — when the other two are known.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formulas used are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Speed = Distance / Time\n",
    "\n",
    "- Distance = Speed × Time\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time = Distance / Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "The program provides a menu-driven system where the user can choose what to calculate. It also includes error handling for invalid inputs, negative values, and division by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Program Logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "Start the Program\n",
    "\n",
    "Display Menu Options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate Speed\n",
    "2. Calculate Distance\n",
    "3. Calculate Time\n",
    "4. Exit\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask the user to choose an option (1–4).\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the user’s choice:\n",
    "\n",
    "If choice = 1 (Speed):\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: Distance, Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Check if inputs are positive and Time ≠ 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula: Speed = Distance / Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Display Speed\n",

    "If choice = 2 (Distance):\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: Speed, Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Check if inputs are positive\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula: Distance = Speed × Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Display Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "If choice = 3 (Time):\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: Distance, Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "Check if inputs are positive and Speed ≠ 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula: Time = Distance / Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "Display Time\n",
    "\n",
    "If choice = 4 (Exit):\n",
    "\n",
    "Display a goodbye message\n",
    "\n",
    "Stop the program\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user enters an invalid choice:\n",
    "\n",
    "Display an error message\n",
    "\n",
    "Show the menu again\n",
    "\n",
